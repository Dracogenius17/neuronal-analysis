    "1. Dynamics/Clustering gradients in the high-dimensional parameter space\n",
    "2. Identification of minimal network: feedforward and feedbackward theory using multilayered networks. \n",

    "4. **Theory for how correlations are created in a network**\n",
    "5. Random sampling – developing a model to infer connectivity structures from functional data. What kinds of features do different connectivities create and can analagous dynamics arise from disparate connectivities? Linear/Nonlinear affects of peripheral neurons as well as combination of different sets of peripheral neurons.\n",

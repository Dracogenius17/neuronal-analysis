NEURONSimData
=============

Graphing of voltage data from NEURON sims of the C. elegans conectome.

NOTE: DATA HERE IS FOR DEV AND DEBUG ONLY. NOT BIOLOGICALLY ACCURATE!

<p>/data contains NEURON generated voltage time series</p>
<p>/utils has the python script to read all .dat files in /data and generate 
graphs in /graphs </p>
<p>/graphs holds the generated graphs. One trace per neuron, one graph per segment.</p>
